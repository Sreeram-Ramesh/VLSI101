## Getting Started With The Datapath: R-Type

Hope y'all had fun exploring the Assembly Language for the MIPS architecture. Now it is time for us to start with th processor design.

Now, this week's task focuses on building the **hardware design** that can execute these instructions ‚Äî starting with **R-type instructions**.


<div align="center"><img src="./media/design-datapath-meme.jpeg" width="400"><br><strong><em> * cough, cough based on true events :'')</em></strong></div>

### Tasks For This Week:

1. **Install Icarus Verilog**, Icarus Verilog is a popular open-source to compile HDLs like verilog, you can either get the latest version from their [official documentation](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html) or get a pre-packaged binary distribution like the one maintained by ubuntu, mentioned in this [medium blog](https://emkboruett.medium.com/installing-icarus-verilog-and-gtkwave-on-ubuntu-for-verilog-simulation-d6d31eee2096)

2. **Install GTKWave**, GTKWave is an open-source tool to visualize analog and digital signals, you can either refer to their [official documentation](https://gtkwave.github.io/gtkwave/) or install and set it up based on the [medium blog](https://emkboruett.medium.com/installing-icarus-verilog-and-gtkwave-on-ubuntu-for-verilog-simulation-d6d31eee2096) again

3. **Simple Implementation** of the MIPS processor, refer to **pgs. 251 to 258** from **Computer Organization book by Patterson and Hennessy** present in resources, start by building the verilog design files for all the base components for R-Type instruction execution. Read through **pgs. 118, 119, 120 and 121** to understand instruction types 

4. **Individually test** each of the components by writing a testbench and looking out for all possible testcases

5. **Create** a `result-<design>.txt` for all the designs of components where the text file consists of all the logs printed by the testbench using **$monitor** or save the waveform file using the gtkwave as a pdf for each design
   
6. **Check For Solutions:** [Week 02](https://youtu.be/G76seRPtboA)

### MIPS Core Elements:

To execute instructions, a MIPS processor uses a combination of key datapath components:

1. **Program Counter (PC)**  
- Holds the address of the current instruction.  
- Increments by 4 to move to the next instruction.

2. **Instruction Memory**  
- Stores the program instructions.  
- Fetches instruction using the address in the PC.

3. **Register File**  
- 32 registers, each 32 bits wide.  
- Provides 2 read ports and 1 write port for operand access.  
- Registers are identified by numbers from 0 to 31.

4. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**  
- Performs all arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., `add`, `sub`, `and`).  
- Inputs: Two operands and a control signal.  
- Outputs: Result and a `Zero` flag (used in branching).

5. **ALU Control Unit**  
- Converts function code and ALUOp to a specific ALU control signal.  
- Ensures the ALU performs the correct operation for each instruction.

6. **Main Control Unit**  
- Takes opcode as input and generates control signals for the datapath.  
- Determines how data flows through the processor based on instruction type.

7. **Data Memory**  
- Used for `lw`, `sw`, etc.  

8. **Top Module (Datapath Integration)**  
- Connects all components to form the MIPS datapath.  
- Simulates instruction execution by coordinating control and data flow.

## Moving On With The Datapath: R-Type

Hope y'all are doing good till now, we are to get started with desiging our R-Type datapath this week, lessgoo!

<div align="center"><img src="./media/charlie-explaining-meme.png" width="400"><br><strong><em> based on live events</em></strong></div>

### Tasks For This Week:

1. **Understanding Machine Language Decoding** for R-Type instructions. Refer pgs. 118, 119, 120 from the Comp Org book for this exercise following this.

2. **Deccode the following** MIPS Assembly instructions into it's machine code:

```asm
add $t1, $t2, $t3
and $t1, $t4, $t5
slt $s1, $s2, $t0
sra $s1, $s2, 4
jr $t0
jalr $t0
```

3. **Upload** a text or a pdf file with the decoded machine code for the above according to MIPS R-Type instruction.

4. **Read** through the simple impementation given in the Comp Arch book pgs. 251 - 258 to understand the datapath, relate it with the machine decoding path, where your brain acted as the datapath and the control unit.

5. **Write a testbench** to test is for all R-Type instructions of the simple implementation, and upload a `result-top-module-rtype.txt` with your simulation results.
